# SkyFlip (Hypixel Skyblock Auction Flipper)

SkyFlip is a Hypixel Skyblock Auction Flipper that utilizes the Hypixel API to identify items that are being sold for less than their value. To do this, SkyFlip has to take into account tons of factors including Reforges and Stars to determine the value of over 60,000 items at any given time. SkyFlip determines item values by first trying to calculate the value of the clean version of it (no modifers such as enchantments, hot potato books, etc.)
Once SkyFlip has determined the clean value of the item, the values of other attributes of the weapon must be account for. This is easier said than done as the hypixel API is not built to be friendly toward outside developers. For example, there is no list of every reforge and their prefixes anywhere on the entire API (as far I know) so I had to load in the data from the Hypixel Skyblock wiki which requires much more effort than just loading a json file.


Using this flipper I have made tens of millions of coins in hypixel skyblock.
