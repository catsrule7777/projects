# HydrusAI (Connect 4 AI)

Hydrus AI is a connect 4 ai I coded in 7th grade (2024). It uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and a transposition table to determine what move to make.

Also attached is a slideshow with a video I made in 7th grade explaining how it works in further depth.
